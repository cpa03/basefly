## Executive Summary

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Critical Issues** | ✅ None found |
| **Build/Lint** | ✅ All quality gates pass (from previous audit) |
| **Stale Branches** | ✅ 1 deleted |
| **Documentation** | ✅ README.md updated |
| **Unused Files** | ✅ 1 temporary file removed |
| **Overall Health** | ✅ EXCELLENT |

---

## Actions Completed

### 1. Documentation Fixes ✅

Updated `README.md` to align with actual project configuration:

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Package manager | bun | pnpm |
| Install command | `bun install` | `pnpm install` |
| Create command | `bun create saasfly` | `pnpm create basefly` |
| Dev command | `bun run dev:web` | `pnpm run dev:web` |
| DB push | `bun db:push` | `pnpm db:push` |
| Vercel deploy | bun commands | pnpm commands |
| Contributors link | saasfly/saasfly | basefly/basefly |
| Performance tool | bun.sh | pnpm |

**Rationale**: The project uses pnpm as specified in package.json (`"packageManager": "pnpm@10.28.2"`), but README referenced bun commands which would fail for users following the documentation.

### 2. Branch Cleanup ✅

Deleted stale merged branch:
- `origin/modularity-engineer`

### 3. Temporary File Removal ✅

Removed temporary file:
- `.sisyphus/ralph-loop.local.md` (local state file, should not be committed)

### 4. Repository Verification ✅

**No critical issues found**:
- ✅ No empty files
- ✅ No build artifacts (.next, dist, build) in repo
- ✅ No temporary/backup files (.tmp, .bak)
- ✅ No files >1MB (except pnpm-lock.yaml which is expected)
- ✅ .gitignore properly configured
- ✅ All quality gates pass (from 2026-02-18 audit)

## Remaining Items (Non-Critical)

### Translation READMEs Need Updates

The following files still reference old branding and bun commands:
- `README_zh.md` - References saasfly/saasfly repo, bun commands
- `README_de.md` - References saasfly/saasfly repo, bun commands, mentions NextAuth (outdated)
- `README_vi.md` - References saasfly/saasfly repo, bun commands, mentions NextAuth (outdated)

**Recommendation**: Update translation READMEs to match main README.md (low priority - main docs are correct).

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify changes
git diff --stat

# View README changes
git diff README.md

# Check branch deletion
git branch -r --merged main | grep -v main
# (should show no output - all stale branches cleaned)
```

## Files Modified

| File | Change Type | Lines |
|------|-------------|-------|
| README.md | Modified | +13, -24 |
| .sisyphus/ralph-loop.local.md | Deleted | -10 |

## Conclusion

The Basefly repository is in **excellent condition**. All critical documentation drift has been corrected, stale branches cleaned, and temporary files removed. The repository is production-ready.

**Repository Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY
