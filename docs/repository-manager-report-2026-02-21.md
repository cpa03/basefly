## Actions Completed

### 1. Dependency Updates ✅

Updated safe dev dependencies (patch/minor versions only):

| Package             | Previous | Updated | Type  |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----- |
| turbo               | 2.8.9    | 2.8.10  | patch |
| @turbo/gen          | 2.8.9    | 2.8.10  | patch |
| eslint-plugin-turbo | 2.8.9    | 2.8.10  | patch |
| happy-dom           | 20.6.3   | 20.7.0  | minor |

**Skipped (risky major updates)**:

- eslint: 8.57.0 → 10.0.1 (major version - requires migration)
- lint-staged: 15.5.2 → 16.2.7 (major version - requires review)

### 2. Quality Verification ✅

All quality gates pass successfully:

```bash
$ pnpm run typecheck
 Tasks:    8 successful, 8 total
 Time:     8.375s

$ pnpm run lint
 Tasks:    7 successful, 7 total
 Time:     36.386s

$ pnpm test
 Test Files  14 passed (14)
       Tests  385 passed (385)
 Duration     5.10s
```

### 3. Security Audit ⚠️

```bash
$ pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate
1 vulnerabilities found
Severity: 1 moderate
```

**Known Limitation - ajv (GHSA-2g4f-4pwh-qvx6)**:

- **Severity**: MODERATE
- **Issue**: ReDoS when using `$data` option
- **Affected paths**: `check-dependency-version-consistency > table > ajv`
- **Mitigation**: Dev dependency only, does not affect production.

### 4. Code Quality Analysis ✅

Searched for common code quality issues:

- **console.log statements**: All intentional (logger utilities, seed scripts, documentation examples)
- **TODO/FIXME comments**: None found
- **Unused imports**: None detected by lint
