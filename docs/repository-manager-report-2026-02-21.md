## Actions Completed

### 1. Documentation Update ✅

### 2. Open PRs Review

| PR # | Title                                                                         | Label             | Status |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| #364 | fix(frontend): improve code quality in code-copy and features-card components | frontend-engineer | OPEN   |

**PR #364 Details**:

- Moves inline SVG styles to CSS class in `code-copy.tsx`
- Uses unique IDs for stable React keys in `features-card.tsx`
- All quality checks pass (lint, typecheck, test)
- Ready for review

### 3. Open Issues Review

| Issue # | Title                                              | Labels                           | Priority |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| #305    | ci: standardize workflows to use pnpm consistently | enhancement, ci, devops-engineer | P1       |

**Issue #305 Details**:

- Workflows use `npm ci` and npm-based caching
- Project uses pnpm as package manager
- Requires updating `on-pull.yml`, `iterate.yml`, `paratterate.yml`
- **Blocker**: Requires GitHub App with `workflows` permission

### 4. Quality Verification ✅

All quality gates pass successfully:

```bash
$ pnpm run typecheck
 Tasks:    8 successful, 8 total
 Time:    17.445s

$ pnpm run lint
 Tasks:    7 successful, 7 total
 Time:    35.735s

$ pnpm test
 Test Files  14 passed (14)
       Tests  383 passed (383)
 Duration     8.12s
```

### 5. Security Audit ⚠️

```bash
$ pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate
1 vulnerabilities found
Severity: 1 moderate
```

**Known Limitation - ajv (GHSA-2g4f-4pwh-qvx6)**:

- **Severity**: MODERATE
- **Issue**: ReDoS when using `$data` option
- **Affected paths**: `check-dependency-version-consistency > table > ajv`
- **Mitigation**: Dev dependency only, does not affect production. The vulnerability only triggers when using the `$data` option, which is not used by our configuration.

### 6. Outdated Packages Check

| Package             | Current | Latest |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| turbo               | 2.8.9   | 2.8.10 |
| eslint-plugin-turbo | 2.8.9   | 2.8.10 |
| happy-dom           | 20.6.3  | 20.7.0 |
| lint-staged         | 15.5.2  | 16.2.7 |

**Recommendation**: These are dev dependencies with minor/patch updates. Consider updating in a future maintenance cycle.
